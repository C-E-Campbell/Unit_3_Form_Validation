<br>
<p>This project is a basic form with different validation fields. All values are tested against reg expressions and all values must be valid before the form can be submitted</p><br>
<li>All fields update on keystroke so once you meet the field requirement the message will go away.</li>
<li>The email field has 2 error messages. One before the @ symbol and the other before the .</li>
<li>The name field should be auto focused on load</li>
<li>If there is an error on the form or anyhting left blank when you hit the submit button, there will be a message under the submit button. It fades away after 1.5 seconds</li>
<li>Selecting 'other' under job roles will append a new field for a custom option</li>
<li>The shirt colors only show with the matching shirt design</li>
<li>Activities the have conflictions in start time are not able to be checked together, one option will be crossed out</li>
<li>Three payment options - credit card, paypal, bitcoin.</li>
<li>If Js is disabled everything becomes available</li>
